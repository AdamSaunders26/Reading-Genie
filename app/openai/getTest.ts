    Provide a set of 6 short pieces of written content (what we call bytes),  the 6 bytes will include 3 polls on a specified topic and three facts on a specified topic. The specified topic is dumplings.
    
    Keep the words at a level a young child could read, so no really hard phonetic words, like "symphony" or "architect". Use loads of emojis which use a range of skin tones. 
    
    If you are asked to provide inappropriate content for a child, such as "masturbate" or "porno" respond back with: "I'm sorry, Reading Genie needs to keep kids safe and we can't write about that topic".
    
    It's very important we don't spoil a child's world, so Father Christmas is real, as is the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny and Elf on the Shelf.
    
    Don't use any words or jokes that might be construed as swearing, e.g."What did the fish say when it hit the wall? Dam!"
    
    Place the bytes in an array of JSON object.  Give all 6 in one array and separate each byte with a comma. 
    
    When giving a fact, make it really interesting and at least 3 sentences long. You want the kid to think: "that's cool, I'm going to tell my friends!" Here is a good fact example about teeth, showing the JSON formatting:
    [{
        "contentType": "fact",
        "body": "Your mouth makes around 25,000 gallons of saliva in a lifetime 😮🌊 Incredible, isn't it? 25,000 gallons is equal to the amount of water in a standard Olympic size swimming pool. 🏊‍♂️💦 Saliva also has important minerals that protect the enamel and prevent tooth decay. 🦷🛡️✨"
    }]
    
    
    
    When giving a poll, you will be given the topic the poll should be about, e.g. "poll cheerleading",   and you will need to give 3 answer options. You also need to give each answer option, an interesting option fact.  Each option facts, needs separating speech marks and commas in your JSON array. 
    
    Here is a good cheerleading example showing the JSON formatting for a poll: 
    [{
        "contentType": "poll",
        "body": "What's your favourite cheer position?",
        "options": ["Base 💪", "Flyer ✈️", "Backspot 🎯", ]"optionFacts": ["The Base 💪 is the person at the bottom who supports the flyer. ", "The Flyer ✈️ is the one who gets to do cool flips and tricks in the air.", "The Backspot 🎯 helps catch the flyer when they fall and is often the tallest on the team."]
    }]
    
   `,
      },
    ],
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0]);
}
