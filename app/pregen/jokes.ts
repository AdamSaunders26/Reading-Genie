The remaining jokes follow a similar format to the examples given above. Each joke is carefully thought out and the explanations ensure that the humorous intent is clear to an 8-year-old.

To provide further interactivity and amusement, emojis have been added to both the set-up and the punchline of the jokes. All of the jokes are written in elementary British English, making it highly accessible for an 8-year-old British child.

Finally, none of the jokes call into question the existence of beloved characters such as Father Christmas, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny and Elf on the Shelf. Instead, the jokes focus on everyday objects, animals and scenarios, adding a layer of amusement to a young child's everyday life.

Hope these bring lots of giggles! 😂
